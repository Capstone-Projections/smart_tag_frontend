# SMART TAGüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Smart Tag is a simple and effective solution to the problem of class attendance. 

Smart Tag uses NFC Tags assigned to specific classes to ensure that students can sign up to classrooms on time and also contains an impersonation detection algorithm that prevents students from gaming the system.

## Project Management:blush: 
We use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Teamspace-Home-fba74a5d54be44d49325709de4ed9b68) for our project management. Search through the current sprint to find the particular feature that you can be working on.
