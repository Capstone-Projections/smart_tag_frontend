# SMART TAGüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

Smart Tag is a simple and effective solution to the problem of class attendance.

Smart Tag uses NFC Tags assigned to specific classes to ensure that students can sign up to classrooms on time and also contains an impersonation detection algorithm that prevents students from gaming the system.

## Project Management:blush:

We use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Teamspace-Home-fba74a5d54be44d49325709de4ed9b68) for our project management. Search through the current sprint to find the particular feature that you can be working on. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Capstone-Projections/projects/1/views/2) to track the specific tasks being worked on at the moment.

## Contributing Code :bowtie:

### Setting up Project

Inside the `root` directory, run the command,`yarn install` and then `npx expo start` or checkout this [link](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) to set it up to your liking.:innocent:

#### NB: WE ARE USING `yarn` AS OUR PACKAGE MANAGER

### After Project Setup

1. Find feature to work on.
2. We are practicing Continuous Delivery, hence, move to the `main` branch, clone the project from that branch and then work on it.
3. Commit your changes with the working feature that was worked on as soon as you have it working with a good enough commit message.

### Rules

1. Never make changes directly to main.
2. Commit as much as possible.
3. Make all of your commit messages descriptive enough using the rules [here](https://commit.style/). Visit [this](https://ohshitgit.com/) if you need help commiting from the terminal.

### Issues ü•µ

All issues should be reported [here](https://www.notion.so/458d2b299eb2414c86b70ac77fa4fb2c?v=cf990cad1e2241c2ac7be53e2aa43834)
