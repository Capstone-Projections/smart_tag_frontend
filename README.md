# SMART TAGüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Smart Tag is a simple and effective solution to the problem of class attendance. 

Smart Tag uses NFC Tags assigned to specific classes to ensure that students can sign up to classrooms on time and also contains an impersonation detection algorithm that prevents students from gaming the system.

## Project Management:blush: 
We use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Teamspace-Home-fba74a5d54be44d49325709de4ed9b68) for our project management. Search through the current sprint to find the particular feature that you can be working on. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Capstone-Projections/projects/1/views/2) to track the specific tasks being worked on at the moment. 

## Contributing Code :bowtie:

###  Setting up Project 
Inside the `root` directory, run the command,`yarn install` and then `npx expo start` or checkout this [link](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) to set it up to your liking.:innocent:
#### NB: WE ARE USING `yarn` AS OUR PACKAGE MANAGER

###  After Project Setup 
1. Find feature to work on. 
2. Create a branch from `main` and name it using the format <username_feature>.
3. After working on the feature on your branch, make a pull request to the `main` branch.
4. The pull request would be reviewed by the project manager and merged into `main`.
5. That branch would then be deleted so as not to keep the number of branches too many.

### Rules 
1. Never make changes directly to main.
2. Commit as much as possible.
3. Make all of your commit messages descriptive enough using the rules [here](https://commit.style/). Visit [this](https://ohshitgit.com/) if you need help commiting from the terminal.

###  Issues ü•µ
All issues should be reported [here](https://www.notion.so/458d2b299eb2414c86b70ac77fa4fb2c?v=cf990cad1e2241c2ac7be53e2aa43834)
